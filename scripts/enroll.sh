== Guided enrollment ($stages presses) for $USER, stored as: $finger
 - Clean, DRY fingertip. Touch LIGHTLY (just cover the sensor) for about half a second,
   then lift fully. Firm presses and sweaty fingers fill the ridge valleys: unclear images.
 - Wait for the "ok" line before the next press.
 - Follow the placement shown before each press; each placement gets 5 presses.
 - "unclear" = press again (lighter, fingertip dry). "lift" = remove the finger first.
 - The first press only checks for an existing print: $first_press.
